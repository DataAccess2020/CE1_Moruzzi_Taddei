# NOTES ON LITERATURE REGARDING HEALTH AND INCOME


#https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.21.2.31
#
# there are two ways in which income could be causally related to health
# 1. direct effect on the material conditions necessary for survival 
# 2. effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances
#
#
# 1
# there are a set of material conditions that are necessary for good health:
# clean water, good sanitation, adequate nutrition, adequate housing and warmth
#
# these material conditions are correlated with income until a certain threshold
# is reached: below the threshold, the lower income, the worse the health because
# of the link with material conditions. Above the threshold level, differences in material
# conditions no longer have any plausible connection with differences in pathology.
#
# For people above the threshold there could still be substantial inequalities
# in health that are related to differing opportunities for social participation,
# for leading a fulfilling and satisfying life, and for control over one's life.
# Depending on how society was organized, these opportunities could show
# a strong direct link with individual income. In this case income would be 
# correlated with health, not through material conditions, but rather through 
# social participation
#
# the author suggests that if we compare rich countries and poor countries the results
# might change a little also due to the intercation of the education factor
#
# moreover, income many times determines the ability to participate in the way defined
# as acceptable by society
#
# The higher the income, the more likely people are to report themselves in 
# good health and the less likely to report depression. Income is only one measure 
# of social position: In Whitehall II the most powerful predictor has always been 
# position in the occupational hierarchy
#
# A tentative conclusion is that in a population above the poverty level, 
# income is important as a predictor of ill health because it is a measure 
# of where a person is in the social hierarchy, rather than because of pounds, 
# dollars, or euros in the pocket

# When speaking of health, it's important to point out that there are many dimension
# of this concept apart from the general one. For example, mental health is a big
# part of what can be considered as "general health". Considering this assumption makes it 
# easier to understand why social inclusion and participation is an important
# element for health.


# Having a stable income, either from employment or through financial support 
# and benefits, is directly related to other determinants of health, namely
# affordable housing andrent, food and transportation to access healthcare
# Social inclusion, or the ability to engage fully in the community,
# is also somewhat dependent on available finances

# THE MACROECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH


#The possibility has therefore been raised that the ecological relationship 
# between income inequality and poor health is not universal, but rather depends 
# on the social policies that governments deploy to mitigate the effects of 
# economic inequalities


# At present, three separate, though not mutually exclusive, mechanisms have 
# been put forward.
# The first is through reduced access to life opportunities, material resources, 
# and opportunity structures. The second set of processes is linked to decreasing 
# social capital that manifests through factors such as erosion of social cohesion, 
# increased social exclusion, and conflict. Third, more direct psycho-social 
# pathways such as hopelessness, lack of control, or loss of respect arising as 
# a consequence of inequality have been identified as having a potential effect 
# on individual health


# The evidence is now overwhelming that poverty (whether conceptualized at the
# country level or at the individual level) is strongly correlated with poorer 
# health outcomes, on average. Moreover, the relationship is likely reciprocal 
# and reinforcing, in that societies burdened with diseases, suffering from 
# endemic diseases, and with lower life expectancies tend to experience low 
# productivity and low and unstable economic growth.
