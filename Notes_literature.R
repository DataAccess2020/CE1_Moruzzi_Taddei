# NOTES ON LITERATURE REGARDING HEALTH AND INCOME


#https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.21.2.31
#
# there are two ways in which income could be causally related to health
# 1. direct effect on the material conditions necessary for survival 
# 2. effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances
#
#
# 1
# there are a set of material conditions that are necessary for good health:
# clean water, good sanitation, adequate nutrition, adequate housing and warmth
#
# these material conditions are correlated with income until a certain threshold
# is reached: below the threshold, the lower income, the worse the health because
# of the link with material conditions. Above the threshold level, differences in material
# conditions no longer have any plausible connection with differences in pathology.
#
# For people above the threshold there could still be substantial inequalities
# in health that are related to differing opportunities for social participation,
# for leading a fulfilling and satisfying life, and for control over one's life.
# Depending on how society was organized, these opportunities could show
# a strong direct link with individual income. In this case income would be 
# correlated with health, not through material conditions, but rather through 
# social participation
