## Introduction

Our research's aim is to investigate the impact of income (at an individual level) on selfperceived health status.
Our hypothesis is that an increase of income level, corresponds a better health status on the individual. 

**M. Marmot** in his paper *The influence of income on health: views of an epidemiologist*, there are two main ways in wich income affects health: a direct effect of income on everyday life (from a material point of view) and an indirect effect on social partecipation an life opportunities. 

About material conditions, as **Fosu and Kwai's** research shows (*Growth, inequality, and poverty reduction in developing countries: Recent global evidence.*), below a certain poverty treshold the direct effect occours the most, above this line the effect is still present, but with a weaker impact.

In regard of indirect effect of income on health, **Forchuk, Cheryl, Dickins and Corring**, in *Social determinants of health: housing and income.*, point out that we shouldn't consider health only as a physical condition, but also its pshycological aspect. Therefore social inclusion is a crucial aspect of individual health (objectively and subjectlively).

## Methods

For our research we used data from the European Values Study (round 2017, for further informations see <https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/methodology-data-documentation/survey-2017/full-release-evs2017/>). 

The variable we chose are the following two:

- `v8` (renamed `health`) which measures self perceived health, divided in five subcategories: *"Very Poor", "Poor","Fair", "Good", "Very Good"* .

-  `v261_r`(renamed `income`)  which measures income level, divided in three subcategories: *"Low Income", "Medium Income","High Income"*.

To see how the two variables are distibuted in our data we made to simple histograms of their distribution:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
